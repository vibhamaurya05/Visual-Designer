## What I learned from this project
* Through this project, I learned to use HTML elements and tags, and also learned how to position them using CSS.
* Learned to create a responsive project where I learned how to make the navbar scrollable.
* And I learned to make the remaining elements and divs responsive as well
## Time taken to complete it
